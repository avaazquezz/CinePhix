## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- MongoDB instance (local or remote)
- TMDb API key (register at [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api))

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/avaazquezz/CinePhix.git
   cd CinePhix
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:
     ```
     MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
     TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key
     JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
     ```

4. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. **Access CinePhix locally:**
   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`

## ðŸ§ª Tests (Unit + E2E)

This repository ships with a basic testing setup for the frontend located in `web_app/`:

- Unit tests: Vitest + @vue/test-utils (Vue 3, jsdom)
- E2E tests: Cypress (runs against the built preview server)

### Where tests live

- Unit tests: `web_app/tests/unit/**/*.spec.js`
- E2E tests: `web_app/cypress/e2e/**/*.cy.js`

### Run tests locally

1) Install dependencies in the web app

```bash
cd web_app
npm install
```

2) Unit tests

```bash
npm run test
```

3) E2E tests (interactive)

```bash
npm run dev
# in a separate terminal
npm run cy:open
```

4) E2E tests (headless)

By default Cypress uses `baseUrl: http://localhost:3000/CinePhix`.

```bash
# Terminal 1: serve the app
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: run Cypress
npm run test:e2e
```

Environment variables: The app calls TMDB. Provide `VITE_TMDB_API_KEY` for local runs (create `web_app/.env`):

```
VITE_TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key
```

Tip: You can also stub TMDB calls in Cypress for faster and deterministic tests.

### Continuous Integration

GitHub Actions workflow: `.github/workflows/tests.yml`

What it does on push/PR to `main`:

1. `npm ci` in `web_app/`
2. Run unit tests (`npm run test:unit`)
3. Build the app (`npm run build`)
4. Start Vite preview on port 3000
5. Run Cypress E2E (`npm run test:e2e`)

Required secret: add `VITE_TMDB_API_KEY` at Repository Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions.
