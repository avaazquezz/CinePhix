# Vuetify (Default)

## Tests

This web app includes two types of tests:

- Unit tests with Vitest + @vue/test-utils (jsdom environment)
- End-to-End tests with Cypress (runs against the local preview server)

Folder layout:
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/**/*.spec.js`
- E2E tests: `cypress/e2e/**/*.cy.js`

Environment: The app calls TMDB. Provide `VITE_TMDB_API_KEY` for local runs (create `.env` in this `web_app/` folder):

```
VITE_TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key
```

Run locally:
- Unit tests
	- `npm run test` (or `npm run test:unit`)
- E2E tests (interactive)
	- `npm run dev` (serve) and in another terminal `npm run cy:open`
- E2E tests (headless)
	- `npm run dev` (serve) then `npm run test:e2e`

How it works:
- Vitest mounts Vue components in a simulated DOM (jsdom) and asserts emitted events, text, etc.
- Cypress visits `http://localhost:3000/CinePhix` (config in `cypress.config.js`), simulates user actions (typing, clicking), and asserts UI results.

CI pipeline (GitHub Actions):
- Installs deps, runs unit tests, builds the app, starts Vite preview on port 3000, waits for it to be up, then runs Cypress headless. Set the repo secret `VITE_TMDB_API_KEY`.

This is the official scaffolding tool for Vuetify, designed to give you a head start in building your new Vuetify application. It sets up a base template with all the necessary configurations and standard directory structure, enabling you to begin development without the hassle of setting up the project from scratch.

## 💿 Install

Set up your project using your preferred package manager. Use the corresponding command to install the dependencies:

| Package Manager                                                | Command        |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started)                   | `yarn install` |
| [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-install)     | `npm install`  |
| [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)                          | `pnpm install` |
| [bun](https://bun.sh/#getting-started)                        | `bun install`  |

After completing the installation, your environment is ready for Vuetify development.

## 💡 Usage

This section covers how to start the development server and build your project for production.

### Starting the Development Server

To start the development server with hot-reload, run the following command. The server will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000):

```bash
yarn dev
```

(Repeat for npm, pnpm, and bun with respective commands.)

> Add NODE_OPTIONS='--no-warnings' to suppress the JSON import warnings that happen as part of the Vuetify import mapping. If you are on Node [v21.3.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v21.3.0) or higher, you can change this to NODE_OPTIONS='--disable-warning=5401'. If you don't mind the warning, you can remove this from your package.json dev script.

### Building for Production

To build your project for production, use:

```bash
yarn build
```

(Repeat for npm, pnpm, and bun with respective commands.)

Once the build process is completed, your application will be ready for deployment in a production environment.

## 🌐 Internationalization (i18n)

- Library: vue-i18n v9
- Language files: `src/i18n/es.json` and `src/i18n/en.json`
- The app detects the browser language on first load and falls back to Spanish.
- The selected language is stored in localStorage and can be changed from the top navigation selector.
- TMDB requests automatically include the current `language` parameter (es-ES/en-US).
